# The results from Propensity Score Matching (PSM) suggest that previous contact 
# significantly increases the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit.

# The estimated treatment effect (coefficient of 'treated') is 0.11152, 
# meaning that customers who were previously contacted are, on average, 
# 11.15 percentage points more likely to subscribe compared to those who were never contacted.

# The effect is highly statistically significant (p-value = 1.65e-09), 
# indicating strong evidence that previous marketing contact impacts subscription behavior.

# After matching, we achieved a well-balanced dataset with 816 treated and 816 control units, 
# ensuring that the treatment and control groups are comparable.

# However, the Adjusted R-squared value (0.02146) is low, meaning that while previous contact 
# has a significant effect, other factors likely influence the subscription decision as well.

# Overall, this analysis supports the causal claim that previous contact increases 
# the likelihood of subscription, but further refinements (such as including additional confounders) 
# could help improve the explanatory power of the model.

# Our Regression Adjustment results reinforce what we found in PSM:  
# Previous contact significantly increases the likelihood of subscription.  
# Customers who were previously contacted are 10.9 percentage points more likely to subscribe (p < 0.001).  
# This closely aligns with our PSM estimate (11.15 percentage points), confirming the robustness of our findings.

# Key Insights:  
# Call duration remains a strong predictor of subscription.  
# Customers with housing or personal loans are less likely to subscribe (p < 0.001).  
# Retired (+), Students (+), Blue-collar (-), and Unemployed (-) groups show significant effects.  
# Unknown contact methods negatively impact subscription rates.  

# Model Takeaways:
# The model explains 21.5% of variation in subscription (Adjusted RÂ² = 0.215).  
# The treatment effect is highly significant (p < 0.001), further validating our causal claim.  

# Conclusion & Next Steps:  
# The consistency between Regression Adjustment and PSM strengthens our confidence in the results.

# Our DiD analysis finds that previous contact significantly increases subscription rates.  
# Customers who were previously contacted (`treated`) are 11.12 percentage points more likely to subscribe (p < 0.001).  
# However, the interaction term (`treated_time`) is not significant (p = 0.645), meaning the effect of multiple contacts  
# compared to a single contact does not show a clear additional boost in subscription rates.  

# Key Takeaways: 
# Time (`campaign > 1`) alone has a negative impact on subscriptions (-2.55 percentage points, p = 0.009).  
# Call duration remains a strong predictor of subscription (p < 0.001).  
# Housing loans (-), personal loans (-), and certain job categories (blue-collar, unemployed) show significant negative effects.  
# Retired customers (+) and married individuals (-) have significant impacts on subscription likelihood.  
# Unknown contact methods significantly reduce subscription rates (-4.73 percentage points, p < 0.001). 

# Final Conclusion:
# The lack of significance in `treated_time` suggests that additional contacts do not substantially enhance subscription rates  
# beyond the first one. This aligns with the idea that the first contact is the most impactful in driving customer decisions.  
# Our results remain consistent with findings from PSM and Regression Adjustment, reinforcing the causal impact of previous contact.  
# We may want to explore Fixed Effects or Causal Machine Learning to further refine our approach.

# Feature Analysis for Individual Treatment Effects (ITE) Reveals Key Patterns  

# Customers Who Benefit the Most from Previous Contact (High ITE)  
# - Higher balance customers tend to respond better to marketing efforts.  
# - Longer call duration is strongly linked to a higher probability of subscription.  
# - Married customers and those with higher education levels are more likely to subscribe after contact.  

# Customers Who Benefit the Least (Low ITE)  
# - Blue-collar, retired, and self-employed customers have significantly lower treatment effects.  
# - Customers contacted via telephone are less likely to respond positively compared to other contact methods.  
# - Shorter calls correlate with lower ITE, indicating lack of engagement leads to ineffective contact.  

# Key Takeaways for Targeting Strategy  
# - Prioritize high-balance, well-educated, and married customers with longer call durations.  
# - Rethink outreach to blue-collar, retired, and self-employed customers, as they show lower response rates.  
# - Improve call engagement strategies to increase conversion rates for lower ITE customers.

# Findings from Causal Random Forest Analysis

# Feature Importance in Treatment Effects  
# - Call duration is the most influential factor in determining subscription likelihood.  
# - Age, balance, and housing status also play significant roles in treatment effects.  
# - Contacting customers via telephone has a moderate impact, suggesting that contact method matters.  

# Distribution of Estimated Individual Treatment Effects (ITE)
# - Most customers have positive treatment effects, meaning previous contact generally increases subscription rates.  
# - A small portion of customers experience negative effects, indicating that outreach may backfire for certain groups.  
# - The distribution suggests variation in response, highlighting the importance of targeted marketing strategies.  

# Conclusion
# Our analysis confirms that previous contact increases subscription rates on average, but the effect varies by customer characteristics.  
# By leveraging causal machine learning, we identified key predictors of treatment effects, helping optimize future marketing efforts.
